## Hi there 👋

I am currently a Computer Science student at a university in Vienna.  
I’ve been interested in computers and technology since childhood and enjoy learning about mathematics, UNIX/Linux systems, and low-level programming in C.
I went through the **C Piscine at 42 Vienna** and actually made it through — so I got some experience with **C** and **shell scripting**.
Currently, I am seeking **summer internships or student positions** to gain real-world experience alongside my studies.

### Fun fact 🎵
I hold **two Master’s degrees from Austrian music universities** and have won multiple **international music competitions**.
